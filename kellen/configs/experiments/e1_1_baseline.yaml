# Experiment E1.1: Baseline Replication
# Goal: Match paper's 87.4% Sudoku-Extreme accuracy on TPU
# Conservative batch size for initial validation

defaults:
  - ../base_sudoku_tpu

# Start with smaller batch size to match paper more closely
training:
  global_batch_size: 256  # 32 per worker (paper uses ~32-128)
  per_worker_batch_size: 32
  lr: 1e-4  # No scaling, use paper's LR directly
  lr_warmup_steps: 2000  # Match paper

checkpoint:
  save_dir: "checkpoints/e1_1_baseline"

logging:
  tensorboard_dir: "gs://your-bucket-name/logs/e1_1_baseline"

# Expected result: ~87% accuracy after 50K epochs
