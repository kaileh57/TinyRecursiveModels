# Experiment E2.2: T/n Schedule - Deeper (T=4, n=6)
# Test if more high-level cycles improve accuracy

  - ../base_sudoku_tpu

model:
  H_cycles: 4  # Increased from 3
  L_cycles: 6  # Paper's value

checkpoint:
  save_dir: "checkpoints/e2_2_t4_n6"

logging:
  tensorboard_dir: "gs://your-bucket-name/logs/e2_2_t4_n6"

# Expected: Possible improvement but slower training
