# Experiment E3.1: Model Scaling - Large
# Test larger model (3× parameters)

defaults:
  - ../base_sudoku_tpu

model:
  L_layers: 4  # Increased from 2
  hidden_size: 1024  # Increased from 512
  num_heads: 16  # Increased from 8

# Use larger batch size to leverage more compute
training:
  global_batch_size: 2048  # 256 per worker
  per_worker_batch_size: 256
  lr: 8e-4  # Scaled accordingly

checkpoint:
  save_dir: "checkpoints/e3_1_large_model"

logging:
  tensorboard_dir: "gs://your-bucket-name/logs/e3_1_large_model"

# Expected: Check if larger model overfits or improves
